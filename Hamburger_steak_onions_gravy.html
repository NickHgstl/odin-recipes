    of ground beef and you probably have all the ingredients on hand!</p>

   <h2>Ingredients (4 people)</h2>
   <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1/4 cup bread crumbs</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon seasond salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 cup thinly sliced onion</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flower</li>
        <li>1 cup beef broth</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cooking sherry</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon seasoned salt</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Steps</h2>
   <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, mix together the ground beef, egg, bread crumbs, pepper,
            salt, onion powder, garlic powder, and Worcestershire sauce. Form into 8 balls,
            and flatten into patties.</li>
            <br>
        <li>Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Fry the patties and onion in
            the oil until patties are nicely browned, about 4 minutes per side. Remove the
            beef patties to a plate, and keep warm.
            <br>
        </li>
            <br>
        <li>Sprinkle flour over the onions and drippings in the skillet. Stir in flour with a
            fork, scraping bits of beef off of the bottom as you stir. Gradually mix in the
            beef broth and sherry. Season with seasoned salt. Simmer and stir over medium-low
            heat for about 5 minutes, until the gravy thickens. Turn heat to low, return patties
            to the gravy, cover, and simmer for another 15 minutes.
   </ol>
